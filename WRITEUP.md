### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*
***	Virtual Machine
* Advantages:
    –	It allows we have full access and control the VM
    –	Unnecessary to purchase hardware
    –	Support of both Linux and Windows OS
    –	We have multiple types and sizes to choose depend on demand with varying amounts of CPUs, RAM and storage
    –	High availability and scaling
* Limitations:
    –	Much more expensive
    –	Need much time to consume for developer to configure, update and maintain...

*** App Service
* Advantages:
    –	Support multiples programming languages such as Python, C#, Java, Nodejs, PHP, Ruby
    –	Quickly Create and deploy web app or backend mobile
    –	High availability and auto-scaling and support both Linux and Windows environments
    –	Vertical or Horizontal scaling
    –	Support CD (Continuous Deployment)
* Limitations:
    –	Limited about list of programming languages
    –	Hardware limitation (maxmimum is 14GB RAM and 4 CPU cores per instance)
    –	Always pays for service plan even if application is not running
    –   Limited access to host server

==>> With cost constraints and acceptable hardware, I choose App Service. Because it is not necessary to spend a lot of time creating a VMs, then configure and update

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 
*** To change my decision:
    –	Increase the number of users
    –	This app is a lightweight application. If this app exceeds the App Services limit configuration (more than 14GB RAM and 4 CPU cores per instance), I will think about a VM for this case
    –	I would like to control Infrastructure such as configuration, upgrade...
    –	I need a VM because of security reasons
